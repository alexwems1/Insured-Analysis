# Insured-Analysis

The code is avaible in the `lol.R` file.

With a series of data which correspond to the claims of an insurer in
Monterrey. It is to analyze and combine the risks of the insurerâ€™s
portfolio. This report is created as a support for the risk committee to
know the influence of the claims with the variables that are known.

The first step is to take a look at our data.

    #>   Kilometres Zone Bonus Make Insured Claims Payment
    #> 1          1    1     1    1  455.13    108  392491

To have a clear idea of the correlation between all the variables in
terms of kilometers, municipality and model. The following graphs were
made.

#### a)Sum of insured per kilometer:

#### b)Sum of claims per kilometer

#### c)Sum of pays per kilometer

We can see in the graphs that a similar trend is followed in the 3 cases
for the relationship between the variables we are using with the
kilometers variable.

#### d)Sum of claims per Zone
